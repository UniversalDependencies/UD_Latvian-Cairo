# Summary

This is an example treebank made to ilustrate UD annotation choices made Latvian, based on Cairo sample sentences. It is created at University of Latvia, Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science, [Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](http://ailab.lv).


# Introduction

This example treebank is developed together with the Latvian UD Treebank (UD_Latvian-LVTB) by the same team with the same workflow and convertion tools. This treebank conains the 20 Cairo example sentences and is meant to be a quick reference on how various syntactic constructions of Latvian are annotated in UD. For more information on Latvian UD Treebank and LVTB see documentation on UD_Latvian-LVTB or [LVTB homepage](http://sintakse.korpuss.lv/).


# Acknowledgments

This work was supported by European Regional Development Fund under the grant agreement No. 1.1.1.1/16/A/219 ([Full Stack of Language Resources for Natural Language Understanding and Generation in Latvian](https://github.com/LUMII-AILab/FullStack)) in synergy with the grant agreement No. 1.1.1.2/VIAA/1/16/188. The pilot project was supported by State Research Programme "National Identity". The work was continued within the State Research Programme "[Digital Resources for the Humanities](http://www.digitalhumanities.lv/projects/DHVPP-en/)" under the grant agreement No. VPP-IZM-DH-2020/1-0001, and now is continued in State Research Programme "[Research on Modern Latvian Language and Development of Language Technology](http://www.digitalhumanities.lv/projects/vpp-late/)" under the grant agreement No. VPP-LETONIKA-2021/1-0006.
